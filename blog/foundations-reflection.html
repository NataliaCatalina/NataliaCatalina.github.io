                <h1 class="title-blog">Foundations Reflection</h1>
                <h2 class="question-blog">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a
                    result of the core learning?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>I learned that I have a very fixed mindset (finding it difficult to explore other ideas) when
                        something gets hard, but it is on me to change that.</li>
                    <li>I learned that reflection is a great way to test if I really understood a concept. if I can’t
                        explain it, that tells me to keep researching and learning more about it.</li>
                    <li>I learned that being in the right mindset is fundamental for the learning process. When I get
                        stressed or stuck with an exercise, I just have to slow down and reconnect with myself.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2 class="question-blog">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and
                    programming?</h2>
                <p>
                    I always thought that programming was a very solitary thing to do but being in this course made me
                    realize that empathy and self awareness are important in the team environment that this work
                    requires. I think that this applies to learning as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My values of communication and equality are important to me and I want the code I write to reflect
                    those values (coded bias, etc)
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
                <p>
                    I was surprised at how important it is to students and future web developers to know all the Core
                    skills. My first thought when I started Dev Academy was that everything was related to coding. Now I
                    understand why most students of Dev academy do so well in the industry!
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part of the core learning was to share my reflections with everyone. I was ok
                    with keeping a document just for me, but having a public blog really took me out of my comfort zone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also really touched me to learn more about neuroplasticity and understanding my fixed mindset. I’m
                    very grateful the core learning taught me so much about myself.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing
                    on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
                <p>
                    Because as developers we need to know how to engage properly in a work environment. Just knowing how
                    to program will give us the basics but having all the social skills will take us beyond.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?
                    Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
                <p>
                    I couldn't be more satisfied with all the core learning that I covered. It was a great balance, as
                    coding was very intense and overwhelming from time to time. The core learning was a moment to
                    lighten the mood and learn about myself.
