                <h1 class="title-blog">Learning Plan</h1>
                <h2 class="question-blog">What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
                <p>My long term goal is to have good knowledge and skills in javascript, and be able to find an
                    internship/job in a big institution where I can keep learning and sharing skills and ideas with
                    other workmates.</p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in
                    yourself while at EDA?</h2>
                <p>I want to be able to express myself intellectually and be able to write in detail about a subject as
                    needed.</p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2>
                <p>I guess my strengths are that I’m hungry to learn, I learn to believe in myself and I know how far I
                    can get with my dedication and constant work.
                    My limitation is my dyslexia and have english as a second language, I struggle to express myself and
                    put my ideas into a paper and my very bad grammar (thanks so much to Grammarly app for making my
                    life easier)
                    I think another of my limitations could be my pregnancy, as it is hard to know how I will feel
                    everyday.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your
                    workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to
                    work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
                    representatives.</h2>
                <p>At the moment having the curriculum really helps a lot to organize the workflow each day. I am also
                    starting to use the pomodoro technique to help me to focus and have break times</p>
                <p>In Bootcamp, I will manage to work productively and safe, keeping a quiet environment and go for a
                    walk and some breathing exercises if I get stress, normally a snack helps a lot for stressful
                    situations too</p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
                <p>I grew up as the only woman in my family and I’m used to having plenty of help, that developed a
                    lazines around investigating what I don’t know on my own. I will work hard to develop my own problem
                    solving skills and if I’m stuck for more than 30 or 40 minutes I will ask for help on slack channels
                    or
                    contact a facilitator.</p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
                <p>I expect them to teach with apples and oranges if necessary, to be as clear as they can and have a
                    motivation that puts our moods up as learning can be very hard for some people (me). I expect them
                    to teach best practices and have a comfortable relationship with them.</p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to
                    other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s
                    important to plan these in.</h2>
                <p>My other scheduling information can be my appointments with my obstetrician, I know I should book
                    appointments with them between 12 and 2, I will try my best with that but it all depends on my
                    doctor's disponibility.</p>
