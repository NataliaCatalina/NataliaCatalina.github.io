                <h2 class="question-blog">What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
                <p>
                    My long term goal is to have good knowledge and skills in javascript, and be able to find an
                    internship/job in a big institution where I can keep learning and sharing skills and ideas with
                    other workmates.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in
                    yourself while at EDA?</h2>
                <p>
                    I want to be able to express myself intellectually and be able to write in detail about a subject as
                    needed.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2>
                <p>
                    I guess my strengths are that I’m hungry to learn, I learn to believe in myself and I know how far I
                    can get with my dedication and constant work.
                    My limitation is my dyslexia and have english as a second language, I struggle to express myself and
                    put my ideas into a paper and my very bad grammar (thanks so much to Grammarly app for making my
                    life easier)
                    I think another of my limitations could be my pregnancy, as it is hard to know how I will feel
                    everyday.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your
                    workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to
                    work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
                    representatives.</h2>
                <p>
                    At the moment having the curriculum really helps a lot to organize the workflow each day. I am also
                    starting to use the pomodoro technique to help me to focus and have break times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Bootcamp, I will manage to work productively and safe, keeping a quiet environment and go for a
                    walk and some breathing exercises if I get stress, normally a snack helps a lot for stressful
                    situations too.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up as the only woman in my family and I’m used to having plenty of help, that developed a
                    lazines around investigating what I don’t know on my own. I will work hard to develop my own problem
                    solving skills and if I’m stuck for more than 30 or 40 minutes I will ask for help on slack channels
                    or contact a facilitator.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
                <p>
                    I expect them to teach with apples and oranges if necessary, to be as clear as they can and have a
                    motivation that puts our moods up as learning can be very hard for some people (me). I expect them
                    to teach best practices and have a comfortable relationship with them.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to
                    other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s
                    important to plan these in.</h2>
                <p>
                    My other scheduling information can be my appointments with my obstetrician, I know I should book
                    appointments with them between 12 and 2, I will try my best with that but it all depends on my
                    doctor's disponibility.
                </p>

                <h1 class="title-blog margin">Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h1>

                <h2 class="question-blog">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
                <p>
                    My long-term goal is to feel comfortable in web development and find a good job that helps me grow as a human and as
                    a developer. Before I preferred large companies, but now I am open to medium-sized companies as well, as long as
                    there is good communication and people are happy to share knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am still very interested in being a JavaScript developer. It is scary as it is taking me time to understand the
                    logic, but I guess practice makes the master.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don’t know what kind of impact I want to make yet but I’m here to discover that.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
                <p>
                    While doing the foundation and investigating more on neuroplasticity, I realized that I have a very fixed mindset. I
                    get disappointed and develop low esteem when I get stuck on an exercise or when it takes me time to understand a
                    concept. That is a huge limitation that I’m working on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My strengths are that I have all the material and intention to change that state of mind. I’m reading <i>Mindset</i>
                    by Dr Dweck, which is helping me to change my belief in myself. It’s filling me with good vibes, and discusses
                    studies that show how it is possible to grow our minds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All this will help me keep a positive state of mind during bootcamp - even if I feel stuck on a concept, I just have
                    to remember that it’s all part of the learning process.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
                <p>
                    My non technical challenge will be to not get lost in my head while a class is in session. Sometimes I have a lot of
                    difficulty paying attention when I don’t understand something so my brain just disconnects from what is happening
                    around me.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while
                    at Dev Academy?</h2>
                <p>
                    My non-technical human skills that I would like to develop are communicating and teamwork. I’m normally good at
                    talking to one other person if I feel comfortable with them, but when there is a big group I get very shy and have a
                    panic attack - unblocking that skill would be great!
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m expecting a friendly and open environment, with a good and positive energy.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
                <p>
                    I expect to foster a healthy, friendly environment with my classmates and the people around me - with the help of
                    resources like:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Pomodoro method works wonderfully for me, so my plan is to keep going with that method to manage my workload.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also if I’m stuck on an exercise I will try to figure it out for myself with Google, but if I can’t find an answer after 40 minutes I will reach out for help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In stressful situations I will do some breathing exercises and go for a short walk, get some fresh air or just a cup of tea as a little break.
