                <p>I was feeling very confident with my JavaScripts until I arrived at the Fizz buzz exercise. To be
                    honest JavaScript is a constant problem that I’m dealing with, and to be more specific I’m having
                    trouble with loops and arrays. I know how it works and I understand most of the time the code when I
                    read it, but for some reason I can't write it myself and it is very annoying because I really like
                    JavaScript, it is like a love and hate relationship.</p>
                <p>In the beginning I get panicked and stressed, I tend to try to relax by taking a break and doing some
                    breathing exercises.</p>
                <p>After that I reread the instructions again and again, I write it in pseudo code.
                    Pseudocode is amazing, because it helps me to organize my code and keep my instructions without
                    interfering with the proper code, and I can delete them when I’m done with it (if I want).</p>
                <p>Then I visited my friend Google, he is a master and he actually knows everything, the only problem is
                    that sometimes I really don’t know how to express myself and ask what I really need.</p>
                <p>If I’m still stuck I send some private messages to people that I feel comfortable with, they are
                    always amazing as they have the patience to explain the logic behind and if they don't know, they
                    encourage me to ask the Foundation chat. I’m very shy when I don’t know people, so I tried to leave
                    the foundation chat as my last resource, but I learned that is a very bad decision, because when I
                    asked for help I got an amazing answer that opened up my mind and made me understand even more.</p>
                <p>I’m still not feeling confident with my JavaScript but I know that I can do it, and I learn that
                    asking for help is a very human thing, I shouldn’t be scared of that.</p>
