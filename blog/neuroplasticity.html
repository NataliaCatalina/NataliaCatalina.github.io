                <h1 class="title-blog">Neuroplasticity</h1>
                <h2 class="question-blog">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
                </h2>
                <p>Our brain is a muscle, and like every muscle in our body, it grows when we train them properly.
                    Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can change every aspect of our life. It can even
                    have a positive impact on mental health and help with recovery from mental illness. Knowing all of
                    that is a huge motivation as it helps us to recognize our abilities and encourages us to feel more
                    comfortable in our learning experiences.</p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your
                    own benefit</h2>
                <p>Reflecting about each topic is a great way to engage with this principle. As I explained before it is
                    hard for me to express myself, for that reason I try to do as much research as I can so I feel
                    confident with my answers.</p>
                <p>Also continuing to learn new things, like JavaScript and coding in general, keeps the mind growing
                    with new knowledge. Living a healthy life with physical exercises, regular rest and a good mindset.
                </p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
                <p>Keep practicing and exercising my brain. I read that video games help with that alot too, I normally
                    play videogames once or twice a week. Also Iâ€™m very bad at reading so I'm challenging myself to read
                    books for my bath times.</p>

                <h1 class="title-blog">Growth Mindset</h1>
                <h2 class="question-blog">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
                <p>Growth mindset is understanding and believing that intelligence is not a gift you are born with. It
                    is understanding that our mind can be developed to a different level with dedication and hard work,
                    this is important because it helps us to overcome obstacles in our learning experiences.</p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
                <p>I was always aware that I have difficulties with learning, reading all this embraces me to keep
                    pushing myself and keep growing my mind.</p>
                <h2 class="question-blog">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
                <p>I will integrate the growth mindset by embracing challenges and being comfortable learning in my own
                    terms</p>
